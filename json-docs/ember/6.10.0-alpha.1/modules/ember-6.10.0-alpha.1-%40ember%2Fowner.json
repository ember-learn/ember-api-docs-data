      "description": "Ember’s dependency injection system is built on the idea of an \"owner\": an\nobject responsible for managing items which can be registered and looked up\nwith the system.\n\nThis module does not provide any concrete instances of owners. Instead, it\ndefines the core type, `Owner`, which specifies the public API contract for an\nowner. The primary concrete implementations of `Owner` are `EngineInstance`,\nfrom `@ember/engine/instance`, and its `ApplicationInstance` subclass, from\n`@ember/application/instance`.\n\nAlong with `Owner` itself, this module provides a number of supporting types\nrelated to Ember's DI system:\n\n- `Factory`, Ember's primary interface for something which can create class\n  instances registered with the DI system.\n\n- `FactoryManager`, an interface for inspecting a `Factory`'s class.\n\n- `Resolver`, an interface defining the contract for the object responsible\n  for mapping string names to the corresponding classes. For example, when you\n  write `@service('session')`, a resolver is responsible to map that back to\n  the `Session` service class in your codebase. Normally, this is handled for\n  you automatically with `ember-resolver`, which is the main implementor of\n  this interface.\n\nFor more details on each, see their per-item docs.",
