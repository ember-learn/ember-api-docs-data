In\nthis context, rendering is completed when all auto-tracked state that is\nconsumed in the template (including any tracked state in models, services,\n  etc.  that are then used in a template) has been updated in the DOM.\n\n  For example, in a test you might want to update some tracked state and\n  then run some assertions after rendering has completed. You _could_ use\n  `await settled()` in that location, but in some contexts you don't want to\n  wait for full settledness (which includes test waiters, pending AJAX/fetch,\n  run loops, etc) but instead only want to know when that updated value has\n  been rendered in the DOM. **THAT** is what `await rerender()` is _perfect_\n  for.",
