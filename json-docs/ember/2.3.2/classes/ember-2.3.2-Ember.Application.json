      "description": "An instance of `Ember.Application` is the starting point for every Ember\napplication. It helps to instantiate, initialize and coordinate the many\nobjects that make up your app.\n\nEach Ember app has one and only one `Ember.Application` object. In fact, the\nvery first thing you should do in your application is create the instance:\n\n```javascript\nwindow.App = Ember.Application.create();\n```\n\nTypically, the application object is the only global variable. All other\nclasses in your app should be properties on the `Ember.Application` instance,\nwhich highlights its first role: a global namespace.\n\nFor example, if you define a view class, it might look like this:\n\n```javascript\nApp.MyView = Ember.View.extend();\n```\n\nBy default, calling `Ember.Application.create()` will automatically initialize\nyour application by calling the `Ember.Application.initialize()` method. If\nyou need to delay initialization, you can call your app's `deferReadiness()`\nmethod. When you are ready for your app to be initialized, call its\n`advanceReadiness()` method.\n\nYou can define a `ready` method on the `Ember.Application` instance, which\nwill be run by Ember when the application is initialized.\n\nBecause `Ember.Application` inherits from `Ember.Namespace`, any classes\nyou create will have useful string representations when calling `toString()`.\nSee the `Ember.Namespace` documentation for more information.\n\nWhile you can think of your `Ember.Application` as a container that holds the\nother classes in your application, there are several other responsibilities\ngoing on under-the-hood that you may want to understand.\n\n### Event Delegation\n\nEmber uses a technique called _event delegation_. This allows the framework\nto set up a global, shared event listener instead of requiring each view to\ndo it manually. For example, instead of each view registering its own\n`mousedown` listener on its associated element, Ember sets up a `mousedown`\nlistener on the `body`.\n\nIf a `mousedown` event occurs, Ember will look at the target of the event and\nstart walking up the DOM node tree, finding corresponding views and invoking\ntheir `mouseDown` method as it goes.\n\n`Ember.Application` has a number of default events that it listens for, as\nwell as a mapping from lowercase events to camel-cased view method names. For\nexample, the `keypress` event causes the `keyPress` method on the view to be\ncalled, the `dblclick` event causes `doubleClick` to be called, and so on.\n\nIf there is a bubbling browser event that Ember does not listen for by\ndefault, you can specify custom events and their corresponding view method\nnames by setting the application's `customEvents` property:\n\n```javascript\nvar App = Ember.Application.create({\n  customEvents: {\n    // add support for the paste event\n    paste: 'paste'\n  }\n});\n```\n\nTo prevent Ember from setting up a listener for a default event,\nspecify the event name with a `null` value in the `customEvents`\nproperty:\n\n```javascript\nvar App = Ember.Application.create({\n  customEvents: {\n    // prevent listeners for mouseenter/mouseleave events\n    mouseenter: null,\n    mouseleave: null\n  }\n});\n```\n\nBy default, the application sets up these event listeners on the document\nbody. However, in cases where you are embedding an Ember application inside\nan existing page, you may want it to set up the listeners on an element\ninside the body.\n\nFor example, if only events inside a DOM element with the ID of `ember-app`\nshould be delegated, set your application's `rootElement` property:\n\n```javascript\nvar App = Ember.Application.create({\n  rootElement: '#ember-app'\n});\n```\n\nThe `rootElement` can be either a DOM element or a jQuery-compatible selector\nstring. Note that *views appended to the DOM outside the root element will\nnot receive events.* If you specify a custom root element, make sure you only\nappend views inside it!\n\nTo learn more about the advantages of event delegation and the Ember view\nlayer, and a list of the event listeners that are setup by default, visit the\n[Ember View Layer guide](http://emberjs.com/guides/understanding-ember/the-view-layer/#toc_event-delegation).\n\n### Initializers\n\nLibraries on top of Ember can add initializers, like so:\n\n```javascript\nEmber.Application.initializer({\n  name: 'api-adapter',\n\n  initialize: function(application) {\n    application.register('api-adapter:main', ApiAdapter);\n  }\n});\n```\n\nInitializers provide an opportunity to access the internal registry, which\norganizes the different components of an Ember application. Additionally\nthey provide a chance to access the instantiated application. Beyond\nbeing used for libraries, initializers are also a great way to organize\ndependency injection or setup in your own application.\n\n### Routing\n\nIn addition to creating your application's router, `Ember.Application` is\nalso responsible for telling the router when to start routing. Transitions\nbetween routes can be logged with the `LOG_TRANSITIONS` flag, and more\ndetailed intra-transition logging can be logged with\nthe `LOG_TRANSITIONS_INTERNAL` flag:\n\n```javascript\nvar App = Ember.Application.create({\n  LOG_TRANSITIONS: true, // basic logging of successful transitions\n  LOG_TRANSITIONS_INTERNAL: true // detailed logging of all routing steps\n});\n```\n\nBy default, the router will begin trying to translate the current URL into\napplication state once the browser emits the `DOMContentReady` event. If you\nneed to defer routing, you can call the application's `deferReadiness()`\nmethod. Once routing can begin, call the `advanceReadiness()` method.\n\nIf there is any setup required before routing begins, you can implement a\n`ready()` method on your app that will be invoked immediately before routing\nbegins.",

Normally,\nEmber will boot a default instance for your Application on \"DOM ready\".\nHowever, you can customize this behavior by disabling `autoboot`.\n\nFor example, this allows you to render a miniture demo of your application\ninto a specific area on your marketing website:\n\n```javascript\nimport MyApp from 'my-app';\n\n$(function() {\n  let App = MyApp.create({ autoboot: false });\n\n  let options = {\n    // Override the router's location adapter to prevent it from updating\n    // the URL in the address bar\n    location: 'none',\n\n    // Override the default `rootElement` on the app to render into a\n    // specific `div` on the page\n    rootElement: '#demo'\n  };\n\n  // Start the app at the special demo URL\n  App.visit('/demo', options);\n});\n````\n\nOr perhaps you might want to boot two instances of your app on the same\npage for a split-screen multiplayer experience:\n\n```javascript\nimport MyApp from 'my-app';\n\n$(function() {\n  let App = MyApp.create({ autoboot: false });\n\n  let sessionId = MyApp.generateSessionID();\n\n  let player1 = App.visit(`/matches/join?name=Player+1&session=${sessionId}`, { rootElement: '#left', location: 'none' });\n  let player2 = App.visit(`/matches/join?name=Player+2&session=${sessionId}`, { rootElement: '#right', location: 'none' });\n\n  Promise.all([player1, player2]).then(() => {\n    // Both apps have completed the initial render\n    $('#loading').fadeOut();\n  });\n});\n```\n\nDo note that each app instance maintains their own registry/container, so\nthey will run in complete isolation by default.\n\n#### Server-Side Rendering (also known as FastBoot)\n\nThis setup allows you to run your Ember app in a server environment using\nNode.js and render its content into static HTML for SEO purposes.\n\n```javascript\nconst HTMLSerializer = new SimpleDOM.HTMLSerializer(SimpleDOM.voidMap);\n\nfunction renderURL(url) {\n  let dom = new SimpleDOM.Document();\n  let rootElement = dom.body;\n  let options = { isBrowser: false, document: dom, rootElement: rootElement };\n\n  return MyApp.visit(options).then(instance => {\n    try {\n      return HTMLSerializer.serialize(rootElement.firstChild);\n    } finally {\n      instance.destroy();\n    }\n  });\n}\n```\n\nIn this scenario, because Ember does not have access to a global `document`\nobject in the Node.js environment, you must provide one explicitly. In practice,\nin the non-browser environment, the stand-in `document` object only need to\nimplement a limited subset of the full DOM API. The `SimpleDOM` library is known\nto work.\n\nSince there is no access to jQuery in the non-browser environment, you must also\nspecify a DOM `Element` object in the same `document` for the `rootElement` option\n(as opposed to a selector string like `\"body\"`).\n\nSee the documentation on the `isBrowser`, `document` and `rootElement` properties\non `Ember.ApplicationInstance.BootOptions` for details.\n\n#### Server-Side Resource Discovery\n\nThis setup allows you to run the routing layer of your Ember app in a server\nenvironment using Node.js and completely disable rendering. This allows you\nto simulate and discover the resources (i.e. AJAX requests) needed to fufill\na given request and eagerly \"push\" these resources to the client.\n\n```js {data-filename=app/initializers/network-service.js}\nimport BrowserNetworkService from 'app/services/network/browser';\nimport NodeNetworkService from 'app/services/network/node';\n\n// Inject a (hypothetical) service for abstracting all AJAX calls and use\n// the appropiate implementaion on the client/server. This also allows the\n// server to log all the AJAX calls made during a particular request and use\n// that for resource-discovery purpose.\n\nexport function initialize(application) {\n  if (window) { // browser\n    application.register('service:network', BrowserNetworkService);\n  } else { // node\n    application.register('service:network', NodeNetworkService);\n  }\n\n  application.inject('route', 'network', 'service:network');\n};\n\nexport default {\n  name: 'network-service',\n  initialize: initialize\n};\n```\n\n```js {data-filename=app/routes/post.js}\nimport Ember from 'ember';\n\n// An example of how the (hypothetical) service is used in routes.\n\nexport default Ember.Route.extend({\n  model(params) {\n    return this.network.fetch(`/api/posts/${params.post_id}.json`);\n  },\n\n  afterModel(post) {\n    if (post.isExternalContent) {\n      return this.network.fetch(`/api/external/?url=${post.externalURL}`);\n    } else {\n      return post;\n    }\n  }\n});\n```\n\n```javascript\n// Finally, put all the pieces together\n\nfunction discoverResourcesFor(url) {\n  return MyApp.visit(url, { isBrowser: false, shouldRender: false }).then(instance => {\n    let networkService = instance.lookup('service:network');\n    return networkService.requests; // => { \"/api/posts/123.json\": \"...\" }\n  });\n}\n```",

          "description": "The goal of initializers should be to register dependencies and injections.\nThis phase runs once. Because these initializers may load code, they are\nallowed to defer application readiness and advance it. If you need to access\nthe container or store you should use an InstanceInitializer that will be run\nafter all initializers and therefore after all code is loaded and the app is\nready.\n\nInitializer receives an object which has the following attributes:\n`name`, `before`, `after`, `initialize`. The only required attribute is\n`initialize`, all others are optional.\n\n* `name` allows you to specify under which name the initializer is registered.\nThis must be a unique name, as trying to register two initializers with the\nsame name will result in an error.\n\n```javascript\nEmber.Application.initializer({\n  name: 'namedInitializer',\n\n  initialize: function(application) {\n    Ember.debug('Running namedInitializer!');\n  }\n});\n```\n\n* `before` and `after` are used to ensure that this initializer is ran prior\nor after the one identified by the value. This value can be a single string\nor an array of strings, referencing the `name` of other initializers.\n\nAn example of ordering initializers, we create an initializer named `first`:\n\n```javascript\nEmber.Application.initializer({\n  name: 'first',\n\n  initialize: function(application) {\n    Ember.debug('First initializer!');\n  }\n});\n\n// DEBUG: First initializer!\n```\n\nWe add another initializer named `second`, specifying that it should run\nafter the initializer named `first`:\n\n```javascript\nEmber.Application.initializer({\n  name: 'second',\n  after: 'first',\n\n  initialize: function(application) {\n    Ember.debug('Second initializer!');\n  }\n});\n\n// DEBUG: First initializer!\n// DEBUG: Second initializer!\n```\n\nAfterwards we add a further initializer named `pre`, this time specifying\nthat it should run before the initializer named `first`:\n\n```javascript\nEmber.Application.initializer({\n  name: 'pre',\n  before: 'first',\n\n  initialize: function(application) {\n    Ember.debug('Pre initializer!');\n  }\n});\n\n// DEBUG: Pre initializer!\n// DEBUG: First initializer!\n// DEBUG: Second initializer!\n```\n\nFinally we add an initializer named `post`, specifying it should run after\nboth the `first` and the `second` initializers:\n\n```javascript\nEmber.Application.initializer({\n  name: 'post',\n  after: ['first', 'second'],\n\n  initialize: function(application) {\n    Ember.debug('Post initializer!');\n  }\n});\n\n// DEBUG: Pre initializer!\n// DEBUG: First initializer!\n// DEBUG: Second initializer!\n// DEBUG: Post initializer!\n```\n\n* `initialize` is a callback function that receives one argument,\n  `application`, on which you can operate.\n\nExample of using `application` to register an adapter:\n\n```javascript\nEmber.Application.initializer({\n  name: 'api-adapter',\n\n  initialize: function(application) {\n    application.register('api-adapter:main', ApiAdapter);\n  }\n});\n```",

This is often used to\nprovide services to a set of framework components.\n\nAn example of providing a session object to all controllers:\n\n```javascript\nvar App = Ember.Application.create();\nvar Session = Ember.Object.extend({ isAuthenticated: false });\n\n// A factory must be registered before it can be injected\nApp.register('session:main', Session);\n\n// Inject 'session:main' onto all factories of the type 'controller'\n// with the name 'session'\nApp.inject('controller', 'session', 'session:main');\n\nApp.IndexController = Ember.Controller.extend({\n  isLoggedIn: Ember.computed.alias('session.isAuthenticated')\n});\n```\n\nInjections can also be performed on specific factories.\n\n```javascript\nApp.inject(<full_name or type>, <property name>, <full_name>)\nApp.inject('route', 'source', 'source:main')\nApp.inject('route:application', 'email', 'model:email')\n```\n\nIt is important to note that injections can only be performed on\nclasses that are instantiated by Ember itself. Instantiating a class\ndirectly (via `create` or `new`) bypasses the dependency injection\nsystem.\n\n**Note:** Ember-Data instantiates its models in a unique manner, and consequently\ninjections onto models (or all models) will not work as expected.
