          "description": "The `fn` helper allows you to ensure a function that you are passing off\nto another component, helper, or modifier has access to arguments that are\navailable in the template.\n\nFor example, if you have an `each` helper looping over a number of items, you\nmay need to pass a function that expects to receive the item as an argument\nto a component invoked within the loop. Here's how you could use the `fn`\nhelper to pass both the function and its arguments together:\n\n  ```handlebars {data-filename=app/templates/components/items-listing.hbs}\n{{#each @items as |item|}}\n  <DisplayItem @item=item @select={{fn this.handleSelected item}} />\n{{/each}}\n```\n\n```js {data-filename=app/components/items-list.js}\nimport Component from '@glimmer/component';\nimport { action } from '@ember/object';\n\nexport default class ItemsList extends Component {\n  @action\n  handleSelected(item) {\n    // ...snip...\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIn this case the `display-item` component will receive a normal function\nthat it can invoke. When it invokes the function, the `handleSelected`\nfunction will receive the `item` and any arguments passed, thanks to the\n`fn` helper.\n\nLet's take look at what that means in a couple circumstances:\n\n- When invoked as `this.args.select()` the `handleSelected` function will\n  receive the `item` from the loop as its first and only argument.\n- When invoked as `this.args.select('foo')` the `handleSelected` function\n  will receive the `item` from the loop as its first argument and the\n  string `'foo'` as its second argument.\n\nIn the example above, we used `@action` to ensure that `handleSelected` is\nproperly bound to the `items-list`, but let's explore what happens if we\nleft out `@action`:\n\n```js {data-filename=app/components/items-list.js}\nimport Component from '@glimmer/component';\n\nexport default class ItemsList extends Component {\n  handleSelected(item) {\n    // ...snip...\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIn this example, when `handleSelected` is invoked inside the `display-item`\ncomponent, it will **not** have access to the component instance. In other\nwords, it will have no `this` context, so please make sure your functions\nare bound (via `@action` or other means) before passing into `fn`!\n\nSee also [partial application](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_application).",

          "description": "Sets the helper manager for an object or function.\n\n```js\nsetHelperManager((owner) => new ClassHelperManager(owner), Helper)\n```\n\nWhen a value is used as a helper in a template, the helper manager is looked up\non the object by walking up its prototype chain and finding the first helper\nmanager. This manager then receives the value and can create and manage an\ninstance of a helper from it. This provides a layer of indirection that allows\nusers to design high-level helper APIs, without Ember needing to worry about the\ndetails. High-level APIs can be experimented with and iterated on while the\ncore of Ember helpers remains stable, and new APIs can be introduced gradually\nover time to existing code bases.\n\n`setHelperManager` receives two arguments:\n\n1. A factory function, which receives the `owner` and returns an instance of a\n  helper manager.\n2. A helper definition, which is the object or function to associate the factory function with.\n\nThe first time the object is looked up, the factory function will be called to\ncreate the helper manager. It will be cached, and in subsequent lookups the\ncached helper manager will be used instead.\n\nOnly one helper manager is guaranteed to exist per `owner` and per usage of\n`setHelperManager`, so many helpers will end up using the same instance of the\nhelper manager. As such, you should only store state that is related to the\nmanager itself. If you want to store state specific to a particular helper\ndefinition, you should assign a unique helper manager to that helper. In\ngeneral, most managers should either be stateless, or only have the `owner` they\nwere created with as state.\n\nHelper managers must fulfill the following interface (This example uses\n[TypeScript interfaces](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/interfaces.html)\nfor precision, you do not need to write helper managers using TypeScript):\n\n```ts\ninterface HelperManager<HelperStateBucket> {\n  capabilities: HelperCapabilities;\n\n  createHelper(definition: HelperDefinition, args: TemplateArgs): HelperStateBucket;\n\n  getValue?(bucket: HelperStateBucket): unknown;\n\n  runEffect?(bucket: HelperStateBucket): void;\n\n  getDestroyable?(bucket: HelperStateBucket): object;\n}\n```\n\nThe capabilities property _must_ be provided using the `capabilities()` function\nimported from the same module as `setHelperManager`:\n\n```js\nimport { capabilities } from '@ember/helper';\n\nclass MyHelperManager {\n  capabilities = capabilities('3.21.0', { hasValue: true });\n\n  // ...snip...\n}\n```\n\nBelow is a description of each of the methods on the interface and their\nfunctions.\n\n#### `createHelper`\n\n`createHelper` is a required hook on the HelperManager interface. The hook is\npassed the definition of the helper that is currently being created, and is\nexpected to return a _state bucket_. This state bucket is what represents the\ncurrent state of the helper, and will be passed to the other lifecycle hooks at\nappropriate times. It is not necessarily related to the definition of the\nhelper itself - for instance, you could return an object _containing_ an\ninstance of the helper:\n\n```js\nclass MyManager {\n  createHelper(Definition, args) {\n    return {\n      instance: new Definition(args);\n    };\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis allows the manager to store metadata that it doesn't want to expose to the\nuser.\n\nThis hook is _not_ autotracked - changes to tracked values used within this hook\nwill _not_ result in a call to any of the other lifecycle hooks. This is because\nit is unclear what should happen if it invalidates, and rather than make a\ndecision at this point, the initial API is aiming to allow as much expressivity\nas possible. This could change in the future with changes to capabilities and\ntheir behaviors.\n\nIf users do want to autotrack some values used during construction, they can\neither create the instance of the helper in `runEffect` or `getValue`, or they\ncan use the `cache` API to autotrack the `createHelper` hook themselves. This\nprovides maximum flexibility and expressiveness to manager authors.\n\nThis hook has the following timing semantics:\n\n**Always**\n- called as discovered during DOM construction\n- called in definition order in the template\n\n#### `getValue`\n\n`getValue` is an optional hook that should return the value of the helper. This\nis the value that is returned from the helper and passed into the template.\n\nThis hook is called when the value is requested from the helper (e.g. when the\ntemplate is rendering and the helper value is needed). The hook is autotracked,\nand will rerun whenever any tracked values used inside of it are updated.\nOtherwise it does not rerun.\n\n> Note: This means that arguments which are not _consumed_ within the hook will\n> not trigger updates.\n\nThis hook is only called for helpers with the `hasValue` capability enabled.\nThis hook has the following timing semantics:\n\n**Always**\n- called the first time the helper value is requested\n- called after autotracked state has changed\n\n**Never**\n- called if the `hasValue` capability is disabled\n\n#### `runEffect`\n\n`runEffect` is an optional hook that should run the effect that the helper is\napplying, setting it up or updating it.\n\nThis hook is scheduled to be called some time after render and prior to paint.\nThere is not a guaranteed, 1-to-1 relationship between a render pass and this\nhook firing. For instance, multiple render passes could occur, and the hook may\nonly trigger once. It may also never trigger if it was dirtied in one render\npass and then destroyed in the next.\n\nThe hook is autotracked, and will rerun whenever any tracked values used inside\nof it are updated. Otherwise it does not rerun.\n\nThe hook is also run during a time period where state mutations are _disabled_\nin Ember. Any tracked state mutation will throw an error during this time,\nincluding changes to tracked properties, changes made using `Ember.set`, updates\nto computed properties, etc. This is meant to prevent infinite rerenders and\nother antipatterns.\n\nThis hook is only called for helpers with the `hasScheduledEffect` capability\nenabled. This hook is also not called in SSR currently, though this could be\nadded as a capability in the future. It has the following timing semantics:\n\n**Always**\n- called after the helper was first created, if the helper has not been\n  destroyed since creation\n- called after autotracked state has changed, if the helper has not been\n  destroyed during render\n\n**Never**\n- called if the `hasScheduledEffect` capability is disabled\n- called in SSR\n\n#### `getDestroyable`\n\n`getDestroyable` is an optional hook that users can use to register a\ndestroyable object for the helper. This destroyable will be registered to the\ncontaining block or template parent, and will be destroyed when it is destroyed.\nSee the [Destroyables RFC](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/blob/master/text/0580-destroyables.md)\nfor more details.\n\n`getDestroyable` is only called if the `hasDestroyable` capability is enabled.\n\nThis hook has the following timing semantics:\n\n**Always**\n- called immediately after the `createHelper` hook is called\n\n**Never**\n- called if the `hasDestroyable` capability is disabled",
