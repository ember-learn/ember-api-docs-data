This is useful when a getter is expensive and\n used very often.\n\n For instance, in this `GuestList` class, we have the `sortedGuests`\n getter that sorts the guests alphabetically:\n\n ```javascript\n   import { tracked } from '---AT-PLACEHOLDER---glimmer/tracking';\n\n   class GuestList {\n     ---AT-PLACEHOLDER---tracked guests = ['Zoey', 'Tomster'];\n\n     get sortedGuests() {\n       return this.guests.slice().sort()\n     }\n   }\n ```\n\n Every time `sortedGuests` is accessed, a new array will be created and sorted,\n because JavaScript getters do not cache by default. When the guest list\n is small, like the one in the example, this is not a problem. However, if\n the guest list were to grow very large, it would mean that we would be doing\n a large amount of work each time we accessed `sortedGuests`. With `@cached`,\n we can cache the value instead:\n\n ```javascript\n   import { tracked, cached } from '---AT-PLACEHOLDER---glimmer/tracking';\n\n   class GuestList {\n     ---AT-PLACEHOLDER---tracked guests = ['Zoey', 'Tomster'];\n\n     ---AT-PLACEHOLDER---cached\n     get sortedGuests() {\n       return this.guests.slice().sort()\n     }\n   }\n ```\n\n Now the `sortedGuests` getter will be cached based on autotracking.\n It will only rerun and create a new sorted array when the guests tracked\n property is updated.\n\n\n ### Tradeoffs\n\n Overuse is discouraged.\n\n In general, you should avoid using `@cached` unless you have confirmed that\n the getter you are decorating is computationally expensive, since `@cached`\n adds a small amount of overhead to the getter.\n While the individual costs are small, a systematic use of the `@cached`\n decorator can add up to a large impact overall in your app.\n Many getters and tracked properties are only accessed once during rendering,\n and then never rerendered, so adding `@cached` when unnecessary can\n negatively impact performance.\n\n Also, `@cached` may rerun even if the values themselves have not changed,\n since tracked properties will always invalidate.\n For example updating an integer value from `5` to an other `5` will trigger\n a rerun of the cached properties building from this integer.\n\n Avoiding a cache invalidation in this case is not something that can\n be achieved on the `@cached` decorator itself, but rather when updating\n the underlying tracked values, by applying some diff checking mechanisms:\n\n ```javascript\n if (nextValue !== this.trackedProp) {\n   this.trackedProp = nextValue;\n }\n ```\n\n Here equal values won't update the property, therefore not triggering\n the subsequent cache invalidations of the `@cached` properties who were\n using this `trackedProp`.\n\n Remember that setting tracked data should only be done during initialization, \n or as the result of a user action. Setting tracked data during render\n (such as in a getter), is not supported.",
