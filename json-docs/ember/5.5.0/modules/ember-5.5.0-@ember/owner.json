      "description": "<html><head></head><body><p>Emberâ€™s dependency injection system is built on the idea of an \"owner\": an\nobject responsible for managing items which can be registered and looked up\nwith the system.</p>\n<p>This module does not provide any concrete instances of owners. Instead, it\ndefines the core type, <code>Owner</code>, which specifies the public API contract for an\nowner. The primary concrete implementations of <code>Owner</code> are <code>EngineInstance</code>,\nfrom <code>@ember/engine/instance</code>, and its <code>ApplicationInstance</code> subclass, from\n<code>@ember/application/instance</code>.</p>\n<p>Along with <code>Owner</code> itself, this module provides a number of supporting types\nrelated to Ember's DI system:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p><code>Factory</code>, Ember's primary interface for something which can create class\ninstances registered with the DI system.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><code>FactoryManager</code>, an interface for inspecting a <code>Factory</code>'s class.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><code>Resolver</code>, an interface defining the contract for the object responsible\nfor mapping string names to the corresponding classes. For example, when you\nwrite <code>@service('session')</code>, a resolver is responsible to map that back to\nthe <code>Session</code> service class in your codebase. Normally, this is handled for\nyou automatically with <code>ember-resolver</code>, which is the main implementor of\nthis interface.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For more details on each, see their per-item docs.</p>\n</body></html>",
