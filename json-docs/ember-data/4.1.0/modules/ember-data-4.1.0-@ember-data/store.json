      "description": "The store contains all of the data for records loaded from the server.\nIt is also responsible for creating instances of `Model` that wrap\nthe individual data for a record, so that they can be bound to in your\nHandlebars templates.\n\nDefine your application's store like this:\n\n```js {data-filename=app/services/store.js}\nimport Store from '@ember-data/store';\n\nexport default class MyStore extends Store {}\n```\n\nMost Ember.js applications will only have a single `Store` that is\nautomatically created by their `Ember.Application`.\n\nYou can retrieve models from the store in several ways. To retrieve a record\nfor a specific id, use `Store`'s `findRecord()` method:\n\n```javascript\nstore.findRecord('person', 123).then(function (person) {\n});\n```\n\nBy default, the store will talk to your backend using a standard\nREST mechanism. You can customize how the store talks to your\nbackend by specifying a custom adapter:\n\n```js {data-filename=app/adapters/application.js}\nimport Adapter from '@ember-data/adapter';\n\nexport default class ApplicationAdapter extends Adapter {\n}\n```\n\nYou can learn more about writing a custom adapter by reading the `Adapter`\ndocumentation.\n\n### Store createRecord() vs. push() vs. pushPayload()\n\nThe store provides multiple ways to create new record objects. They have\nsome subtle differences in their use which are detailed below:\n\n[createRecord](../methods/createRecord?anchor=createRecord) is used for creating new\nrecords on the client side. This will return a new record in the\n`created.uncommitted` state. In order to persist this record to the\nbackend, you will need to call `record.save()`.\n\n[push](../methods/push?anchor=push) is used to notify Ember Data's store of new or\nupdated records that exist in the backend. This will return a record\nin the `loaded.saved` state. The primary use-case for `store#push` is\nto notify Ember Data about record updates (full or partial) that happen\noutside of the normal adapter methods (for example\n[SSE](http://dev.w3.org/html5/eventsource/) or [Web\nSockets](http://www.w3.org/TR/2009/WD-websockets-20091222/)).\n\n[pushPayload](../methods/pushPayload?anchor=pushPayload) is a convenience wrapper for\n`store#push` that will deserialize payloads if the\nSerializer implements a `pushPayload` method.\n\nNote: When creating a new record using any of the above methods\nEmber Data will update `RecordArray`s such as those returned by\n`store#peekAll()` or `store#findAll()`. This means any\ndata bindings or computed properties that depend on the RecordArray\nwill automatically be synced to include the new or updated record\nvalues.",
