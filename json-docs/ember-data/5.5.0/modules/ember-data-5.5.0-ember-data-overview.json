EmberData is:\n\n- ‚ö°Ô∏è Committed to Best-In-Class Performance\n- üíö Typed\n- ‚öõÔ∏è Works with any API\n- üå≤ Focused on being as tiny as possible\n- üöÄ SSR Ready\n- üîú Seamless reactivity in any framework\n- üêπ Built with ‚ô•Ô∏è by [Ember](https://emberjs.com)\n\n\n## Basic Installation\n\nInstall using your javascript package manager of choice. For instance with [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)\n\n```\npnpm add ember-data\n```\n\n`ember-data` is installed by default for new applications generated with `ember-cli`. You can check what version is installed by looking in the `devDependencies` hash of your project's [package.json](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/configuring-npm/package-json) file.\n\nIf you have generated a new `Ember` application using `ember-cli` but do\nnot wish to use `ember-data`, remove `ember-data` from your project's `package.json` file and run your package manager's install command to update your lockfile.\n\n## Advanced Installation\n\nEmberData is organized into primitives that compose together via public APIs. These primitives are organized into\nsmall packages encapsulating these boundaries. These packages\ndeclare peer-dependencies (sometimes optional peer dependencies)\non the other EmberData\\/WarpDrive packages they require use of.\n\n- [@ember-data/request](../modules/@ember-data%2Frequest) provides managed `fetch`\n- [@ember-data/request-utils](../modules/@ember-data%2Frequest-utils) provides optional utilities for managing requests and string manipulation\n- [@ember-data/store](../modules/@ember-data%2Fstore) provides core functionality around coordinating caching and reactivity\n- [@ember-data/json-api](../modules/@ember-data%2Fjson-api) provides a cache for data in the [{JSON:API}](https://jsonapi.org) format.\n- [@ember-data/debug](../modules/@ember-data%2Fdebug) provides (optional) debugging support for the `ember-inspector`.\n- [@warp-drive/build-config](../modules/@warp-drive%2Fbuild-config) provides a build plugin which ensures proper settings configuration for deprecations, optional features, development/testing support and debug logging.\n- [@warp-drive/core-types](../modules/@warp-drive%2Fcore-types) provides core types and symbols used by all other packages\n- [@warp-drive/schema-record](../modules/@warp-drive%2Fschema-record) provides a flexible, schema-based approach to reactive data.\n- [@warp-drive/ember](../modules/@warp-drive%2Fember) provides Ember specific components and utilities for reactive control-flow and declarative state management.\n\nSome EmberData APIs are older than others, and these still interop via well-defined\npublic API boundaries but are no longer the ideal approach.\n\n- [@ember-data/model](../modules/@ember-data%2Fmodel) provides a class-based approach to declaring schemas for reactive data.\n- [@ember-data/legacy-compat](../modules/@ember-data%2Flegacy-compat) provides support for the older adapter/serializer request paradigm that is being phased out\n- [@ember-data/adapter](../modules/@ember-data%2Fadapter) provides various network API integrations for APIs built over specific REST or [{JSON:API}](https://jsonapi.org) conventions.\n- [@ember-data/serializer](../modules/@ember-data%2Fserializer) provides an approach to normalizing and serializing data to and from an API format into the [{JSON:API}](https://jsonapi.org) format.\n\nAnd finally:\n\n- `ember-data` is a \"meta\" package which bundles many of these together for convenience in a \"legacy\" configuration.\n\n## Configuration Settings\n\n- [Configuration Settings](../modules/@warp-drive%2Fbuild-config)",
