      "description": "## Deprecations\n\nEmberData allows users to opt-in and remove code that exists to support deprecated\nbehaviors.\n\nIf your app has resolved all deprecations present in a given version,\nyou may specify that version as your \"compatibility\" version to remove\nthe code that supported the deprecated behavior from your app.\n\nFor instance, if a deprecation was introduced in 3.13, and the app specifies\n3.13 as its minimum version compatibility, any deprecations introduced before\nor during 3.13 would be stripped away.\n\nAn app can use a different version than what it specifies as it's compatibility\nversion. For instance, an App could be using `3.16` while specifying compatibility\nwith `3.12`. This would remove any deprecations that were present in or before `3.12`\nbut keep support for anything deprecated in or above `3.13`.\n\n### Configuring Compatibility\n\nTo configure your compatibility version, set the `compatWith` to the version you\nare compatible with on the `emberData` config in your `ember-cli-build.js` file.\n\n```js\nlet app = new EmberApp(defaults, {\n  emberData: {\n    compatWith: '3.12',\n  },\n});\n```\n\nThe complete list of which versions specific deprecations will be removed in\ncan be found [here](https://github.com/emberjs/data/tree/master/packages/private-build-infra/addon/current-deprecations.ts \"List of EmberData Deprecations\")",
