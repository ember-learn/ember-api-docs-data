      "hasmany": "('user') friends;",
      "belongsto": "('location') house;",
      "attr": "('string') name;\n }\n ```\n\n ```js\n {\n   id: 1,\n   name: 'Sebastian',\n   friends: [3, 4],\n   links: {\n     house: '/houses/lefkada'\n   }\n }\n ```\n\n `JSONSerializer` will normalize the JSON payload to the JSON API format that the\n Ember Data store expects.\n\n You can customize how JSONSerializer processes its payload by passing options in\n the `attrs` hash or by subclassing the `JSONSerializer` and overriding hooks:\n\n   - To customize how a single record is normalized, use the `normalize` hook.\n   - To customize how `JSONSerializer` normalizes the whole server response, use the\n     `normalizeResponse` hook.\n   - To customize how `JSONSerializer` normalizes a specific response from the server,\n     use one of the many specific `normalizeResponse` hooks.\n   - To customize how `JSONSerializer` normalizes your id, attributes or relationships,\n     use the `extractId`, `extractAttributes` and `extractRelationships` hooks.\n\n The `JSONSerializer` normalization process follows these steps:\n\n   1. `normalizeResponse`\n       - entry method to the serializer.\n   2. `normalizeCreateRecordResponse`\n       - a `normalizeResponse` for a specific operation is called.\n   3. `normalizeSingleResponse`|`normalizeArrayResponse`\n       - for methods like `createRecord` we expect a single record back, while for methods like `findAll` we expect multiple records back.\n   4. `normalize`\n       - `normalizeArrayResponse` iterates and calls `normalize` for each of its records while `normalizeSingle`\n         calls it once. This is the method you most likely want to subclass.\n   5. `extractId` | `extractAttributes` | `extractRelationships`\n       - `normalize` delegates to these methods to\n         turn the record payload into the JSON API format.",
